    <h1>Abstract</h1>
      <h2>User Needs</h2>
        <p>Our users, the individuals who run animal foster systems, need objective insights outside of their personal experience with that specific shelter on getting adoptions.</p>
      <p>First, as writers of pet adoption listings online, they need empirical guidance on writing successful listings for the given animal.
            They have anecdotally noticed certain traits in listings being more successful from older listings, but gained this from experience limited to certain animal types and responses to their particular shelter as opposed to having an objective view.
            Listing descriptions have been extremely consistent as they use a single writer, but this also means no experimentation on what stylistic choices may be better for certain animals.
            The listing creators need to understand this without taking risks with changing up the listings for their own animals.</p>
      <p>Second, as the decision makers of what animals to adopt, they want to understand the adoptability of certain animals given their physical or behavioral traits before they are taken on by the organization.</p>

      <h2>Motivating Questions</h2>
        <p>What writing styles would make this animal more adoptable?</p>
        <p>What kinds of photos should we take to make this animal more adoptable?</p>
        <p>What traits in animals should we look out for as red flags for being unadoptable, or green flags for being adoptable?</p>

      <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>Writers need to build intuition to emulate a good "writing style" and "photography style".
            On top of being hard to thoroughly quantify traits of these artistic fields into a visualization,
            our users would benefit less from them as it would be harder for them to generate their own listings based on quantitative dimensions.
            So, we proposed a visualization that pulls only example listings to be used as stylistic references.
            These would be selected based on how quickly the animal was adopted.</p>
        <p>To identify unadoptable animals, we could separately visualize what specific traits may be more or less desirable.
            We want to quantify adoptability of certain traits by the adoption rates of animals with or without that trait.</p>

    <h1>Visualization: Timeline of fastest adopted pets</h1>
      <p>Find pet listings by how long it took for the animal to be adopted. Click any point to open the full listing to use as a reference. You can zoom in and out of the timeline by clicking into it and scrolling, and pan by draggingâ€” we've zoomed in on the 10 fastest adopted listings for you.</p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    <p>Our visualization addressses a task outlined in our preparation stages for this project: Assuming an ideal listing for an animal, what is the expected time until adoption? We decided to examine the animals who were adopted the quickest and show them on a timeline, with options to click on the points on the timeline and view these animals. This way, one can input their animal's unchangeable traits, such as species and age, and see the top fastest adopted animals with those traits. This visualization has several interactive componenets to it. Users can scroll up to zoom in and down to zoom out of sections of the timeline. Click on the dot to open a tab with the animal which is presented in that part of the timeline.</p>
